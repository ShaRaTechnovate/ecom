                        </p>
                        <p>Delivery fees and times vary for different products and are calculated based
                            on the size and weight of your order and its destination. The delivery price
                            for each order will be displayed during the checkout process, prior to payment
                            and order confirmation and included in the total price of your order.</p>
                        <p>#### Delivery time</p>
                        <p>Typically, delivery occurs within 10 working days of us
                            receiving your payment authorisation and cleared funds.
                            In some cases the estimated delivery time frame will be
                            longer, for example where items are made to order.
                            From time to time the delivery of specific items will
                            exceed our usual 10 working day  delivery window for
                            reasons outside our control. We work hard to process
                            all orders as quickly as possible and we will send you
